is a corpus in which we are collecting all Calderón de la Barca’s autos sacramentales in a searchable, text-reading, text-mining data database that will be open eventually to all scholars. With this project we aim to annotate all Calderón’s database in a way that the annotations will be linguistic in nature, but they will also reveal metainformation about the structures in which these linguistic information ocurrs. Calderonlab will be used in first instance for sentiment analysis, but the nature of the project will allow any type of metasearch about how concepts are implemented in this corpus. The types of annotations we will produce regarding emotions will be: characters’ gender, characters’ moral value (protagonist, antagonist, adjuvant), position in the dramatic structure (exposition-rising action-climax-denouement), and year of production; also in verses, stage directions, and in metaphors present in the text. This will allow us to study: the emotions fostered in the Counter-Reformation in the pen of Calderón and their evolution during the years in quantifiable terms; how emotions are ascribed to social, gender or age types or stereotypes; how emotions are deployed in the different parts of the dramatic structure and how they shape the dramatic structure; and a deeper understanding of how Calderón envisions human cognitive apparatus checking which emotions he attaches to cognitive processes. This database will be available in a web application accessible to desktop and laptop computers, tablets and mobile devices.
