<h1 id="agile-manifesto-principles-and-practices">Agile Manifesto, Principles and Practices</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read: Class book, chapter 1 (Agile Practices)</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/">The Agile Manifesto</a>
<ul>
<li>What are the four key statements of the manifesto?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Link each of <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">the 12 agile principles</a> to one or more of the values from the manifesto:
<ol type="1">
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol></li>
