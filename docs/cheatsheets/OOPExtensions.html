<h1 id="object-oriented-programming-extension-mechanisms">Object-Oriented-Programming Extension mechanisms</h1>
<h2 id="relationships-between-classes-and-objects">Relationships between classes and objects</h2>
<p>Classes and objects on their own are not too hard to understand. The challenge starts when classes and objects interact with each other.</p>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss how object objects learn about each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>The object may directly call the constructor of the other object’s class and create this object. For instance a class implementing a stack may create an array to hold the stack elements.</li>
<li>They may be given an object during their construction, as arguments to their constructor.</li>
<li>They may be given an object during a method call, as arguments to that method.</li>
<li>They may obtain an object by calling a method of another object they already know about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these four methods the first one stand out, as it creates a very tight coupling: <em>The creator object knows exactly what class the created object is</em>. In all the other cases the only information communicated is the <em>interface</em> of the object.</p>
<h2 id="extension-mechanisms">Extension Mechanisms</h2>
<p>There are numerous mechanisms that allow us to <strong>extend</strong> the functionality provided by a certain class. The main two mechanisms are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>class inheritance</strong>, in which we extend the functionality offered by a class by creating a subclass of it. This is often described as an <em>is-a</em> relationship.</li>
<li><strong>object composition</strong>, in which we use objects of other classes via fields in our new class. This is often described as a <em>has-a</em> relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example. Consider a simple <code>Grade</code> class:</p>
<pre class="java"><code>class Grade {
    private final String letter;

    public Grade(String letter) {
        throwExceptionIfInvalidLetter();
        this.letter = letter;
    }

    public int getPoints() { ... }
    public boolean countsForCredit() { ... }
    public String getLetter() { return letter; }
}</code></pre>
<p>We now want to create a <code>UnitGrade</code> class. It needs to allow for both a letter grade and also the amount of units that the class is worth (1, 0.5 etc). We have fundamentally two options for the design of this new class:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The <em>inheritance</em> approach says that we should create a new <em>subclass</em> of the <code>Grade</code> class which also contains a new field, for the units:</p>
<pre class="java"><code>class UnitGrade extends Grade {
    private final double units;

    public UnitGrade(String letter, double units) {
        super(letter);   // Call Grade constructor
        this.units = units;
    }

    public double getUnits() { return units; }
    // countsForCredit is inherited
    // getLetter is inherited
    public int getPoints() {
        return units * super.getPoints();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We use the term <code>extends Grade</code> to indicate that this is a subclass of <code>Grade</code>, and will therefore inherit everything that <code>Grade</code> has. In this instance we automatically get for free the <code>countsForCredit</code> and <code>getLetter</code> methods. We have to modify the implementation of <code>getPoints</code> because it has to take into account the <code>units</code>. We can use the <code>super</code> keyword whenever we have to refer to the superclass.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>composition</em> approach says that we should create a new class that has a <code>grade</code> field in it and a <code>units</code> field in it.</p>
<pre class="java"><code>class UnitGrade {
    private Grade grade;
    private double units;

    public UnitGrade(String letter, double units) {
        this.grade = new Grade(letter);
        this.units = units;
    }
    // other possible constructor, receiving an external grade
    public UnitGrade(Grade grade, double units) {
        this.grade = grade;
        this.units = units;
    }

    // Delegations
    public boolean countsForCredit() { return grade.countsForCredit(); }
    public String getLetter() { return grade.getLetter(); }

    public getUnits() {
        return units * grade.getUnits();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case a <code>UnitGrade</code> instance contains a <code>Grade</code> instance as a field, and it can refer to it for information. In particular, some of the methods of <code>UnitGrade</code> simply return a corresponding call to <code>grade</code>. This is called <strong>delegation</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance is a bit easier to understand, and requires less code to implement. Composition on the other hand requires more work, via delegation for example.</li>
<li>Inheritance fixes the implementation of Grade at compile-time. If we wanted to instead use a subclass of the <code>Grade</code> class (maybe some specialized “pass/fail grade subclass”, we cannot do that. In other words, <em>inheritance directly links the two classes</em>. On the other hand with composition, the field <code>grade</code> can belong to any subclass of <code>Grade</code>. <em>Composition allows the specific class that is used to be determined at runtime, and to even change in the lifetime of an application.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, <em>inheritance is a static compile-time source-code dependency between <strong>classes</strong>, while composition is a dynamic run-time dependency between <strong>objects</strong>.</em></p>
<p>In UML notation, these two dependencies are drawn differently: inheritance is a hollow-point arrow, often drawn in a consistent vertical direction, while composition is a filled-point arrow, often drawn in a horizontal direction.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Reader.html">Reader</a> class provides an interface for reading from character input streams. It has methods like <code>read()</code>, <code>ready()</code>, <code>skip(n)</code>, <code>close()</code>. It is actually an <em>abstract class</em>, with a number of implementations. So for this discussion you should think of it more of as an interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/CharArrayReader.html">CharArrayReader</a> is a concrete subclass of <code>Reader</code> which reads its contents from a provided character array. It is anexample of <em>inheritance</em>, as it inherits some functionality from the abstract class.</li>
<li><a href="InputStreamReader">InputStreamReader</a> is another concrete subclass of <code>Reader</code> that reads its input from an “input stream” (like the terminal standard input). It is also an example of <em>inheritance</em>. In order to do its work, it takes as argument to its constructor an <code>InputStream</code>. It is therefore an example of <em>composition</em> as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html">BufferedReader</a> is a subclass of <code>Reader</code>. It takes in as input another object <code>in</code> of type <code>Reader</code>, and “buffers” the read input by reading it in specified chunks. It is therefore an example of <em>composition</em>. At the same time, it is also an example of <em>inheritance</em>, as it inherits some functionality from <code>Reader</code> via the subclass relationship. This is an example of a <strong>decorator</strong>: It both inherits from the <code>Reader</code> class as well as composes from it: It effectively acts as a “decoration” to the existing behavior of some other Reader, rather than directly providing the Reader behavior itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/LineNumberReader.html">LineNumberReader</a> is a subclass of <code>BufferedReader</code> which further keeps track of line numbers. This is an example of <em>inheritance</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PRACTICE</strong>: Draw a UML diagram containing all these classes and their relationships.</p>
