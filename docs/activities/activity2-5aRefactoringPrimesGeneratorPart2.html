<h1 id="activity-2-5a-refactoring-the-numberprinter-class">Activity 2-5a Refactoring: The <code>NumberPrinter</code> Class</h1>
<p>This activity continues the refactoring of <code>primeGenerator</code> that you began in Activity 2-4.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-refactor-the-print-method">Step 4: Refactor the <code>print</code> method</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first thing to clean up are the parameters for the <code>print</code> method: <code>int numPrimes</code> and <code>int[] primes</code>.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Although the second parameters is called <code>primes</code>, in theory it could be any array of numbers. Perform a <strong>Rename</strong> refactoring to change the name of <code>primes</code> to <code>numbers</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The parameter <code>numPrimes</code> indicates how many numbers to print. We can just use the length of the <code>numbers</code> array instead, which makes the <code>numPrimes</code> parameter unnecessary. Fix this in a stepwise fashion as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the first use of the <code>numPrimes</code> variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>Extract Variable</strong> refactoring to create a local variable called <code>numberOfNumbers</code>. When asked, be sure to replace all 3 occurences. Also, renaming the variable will be the last thing you do.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the <code>numberOfNumbers = ...</code> assignment to instead be</p>
<pre class="java"><code>numberOfNumbers = numbers.length - 1</code></pre>
<p>(Note: the numbers in the array actually start at index 1.)</p></li>
<li><p>Run the tests to make sure they still work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>numPrimes</code> parameter should now be grayed out as it is no longer being used. Use <strong>Safe Delete</strong> to remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the parameter.</li>
<li>Use <code>&lt;alt&gt;-ENTER</code> to show the available intentions and select <strong>Safe Delete</strong>.</li>
<li>Run tests again.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The next thing to do is simplify the <code>while</code> loop by extracting various methods.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The first five lines of the <code>while</code> loop are <code>System.out</code> calls. Together these lines print the header for a page. Select these lines and extract them into a method called <code>printHeader</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next inside the <code>while</code> loop is the double for loop that is responsible for actually printing the numbers on the page. Extract a method called <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> from the double for loop.</p></li>
<li><p>The last three lines of the <code>while</code> loop update the <code>pageNumber</code> and <code>pageOffset</code> counters as we advance through each page. These three lines also need to be turned into a method, but you notice that, <code>pageNumber</code> is being used by the <code>printHeader</code> method, and <code>pageOffset</code> is being used by the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method. Also, the variable <code>numberOfNumbers</code> is being used by both those methods. Before turning the last three lines into a method, <code>pageNumber</code>, <code>pageOffset</code>, and <code>numberOfNumbers</code> need to beneed to be elevated from local variables into class fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select any one of the <code>pageNumber</code> references and refactor to <strong>Extract Field</strong>. Keep the same name for the name of the field.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to extract <code>pageOffset</code> and <code>numberOfNumbers</code> into fields as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now extract a method called <code>moveToNextPage</code> from the last three lines of the while loop.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Clean up the parameters of the newly created methods.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Because <code>pageNumber</code> and <code>numberOfNumbers</code> are now fields, they no longer nee to be passed into the <code>printHeader</code> method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go down to where the <code>printHeader</code> method is being defined.</li>
<li>Select <code>pageNumber</code> in the parameter list.</li>
<li>Use refactoring to <strong>Inline</strong> the parameter.</li>
<li>Repeat this process to inline the <code>numberOfNumbers</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Remove the superfluous <code>this</code> that was added to the <code>pageNumber</code> and <code>numberOfNumbers</code> references in <code>printHeader</code>.</li>
<li>Run tests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Repeat the steps above to inline the <code>pageOffset</code> and <code>numberOfNumbers</code> parameters used by the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method. If a line is created initializing <code>pageOffset</code> as a local variable, delete this line.</p></li>
<li><p><code>numbers</code> is now the only parameter that remains for <code>printNumbersOfPage</code>, an it makes sense to also extract <code>numbers</code> into a field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to the <code>print</code> method.</li>
<li>Select <code>numbers</code> in the line initializing <code>numberOfNumbers</code>, and extract it as a field. Be sure to check the box to replace all occurences.</li>
<li>Now if you run your tests, they should now fail, because IntelliJ did not actually add a statement to initialize <code>this.numbers</code> to equal the parameter <code>numbers</code>. Add the line <code>this.numbers = numbers</code> to the top of the <code>print</code> method.</li>
<li>Run tests to verify they are again passing.</li>
<li>Back in the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method, use <strong>Safe Delete</strong> to delete <code>numbers</code> from the parameter list, and remove the superfluous <code>self.</code> in the next-to-last line of the method.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The first four lines of the <code>print</code> method are now all about initializing fields. Extract these lines into a method called <code>initialize</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The boolean expression in the <code>while</code> loop is determining if there are still more numbers to print. Select this expresssion an extract it into a metho called <code>needToPrintMore</code>. Keep the original signature when asked, and <em>do not</em> replace other occurrences when asked.</p></li>
<li><p>The last thing to do is to clean up the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Down to the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method, select the conditional inside the nested for loop and extract it as a method called <code>printNumberAt</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>To to the newly created <code>printNumbersAt</code> method. <strong>NOT SURE WHAT TO DO HERE</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Notice that this new method takes two parameters but really only uses one, namely their combination as “row offset plus column offset times rows per page”. Extract parameter from that expression, and tell it to replace both occurences. It should also remove the other two parameters in this case.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>Let’s look at the row-offset variable of the outer loop. It seems to be initialized as page offset, then stop at a boundary similarly depending on page offset. It is only used in the index computation. Change it so that it instead starts at 0 and ends at rows-per-page minus 1, and change the index computation to include an additional page-offset. Run your tests to make sure they still pass. Maybe also perform a Rename refactoring to now call the variable <code>row</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking at the stopping tests in our for loops, we are more used to seeing them with a less than comparison, rather with a “less than or equal to the number minus 1” comparison. So fix those up, and run our tests to make sure they still pass.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-5-reducing-the-number-of-fields">Step 5: Reducing the number of fields</h2>
<p>The <code>NumberPrinter</code> class has quite a few fields. Some of these, like <code>pageOffset</code>, are not used in too many places and could be replaced by a simple calculation, e.g., calculating <code>pageOffset</code> from <code>pageNumber</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Encapsulate <code>pageOffset</code> so that it is only accessible through an accessor method.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Select <code>pageOffset</code> and refactor to <strong>Encapsulate Fields</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Unckeck <em>Set access</em>. (The goal is to eliminate the need for this field, so it makes no sense to be creating a setter.)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactor to replace all accesses to this field with a call to <code>getPageOffset()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run tests to make sure nothing was broken.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Change the <code>getPageOffset</code> method so that it computes <code>pageOffset</code> from <code>pageNumber</code> and return it.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The computation should be “page number minus 1 then times rows per page and times columns per page, then add one to the result.”</p></li>
<li><p>Run our tests to make sure this change did not break anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Up at the top of the class, the <code>pageOffset</code> field should now be grayed out where it is being declared. Use <strong>Safe delete</strong> to remove the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the tests again.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The <code>numberOfNumbers</code> field can also be removed with a bit of refactoring. It is not used much, an it can be computed easily from the <code>numbers</code> array.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Use refactoring on <code>numberOfNumbers</code> to encapsulate the field. Again, you only need to create a getter for this field, not a setter.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the body of the new getter to instead return the length of the numbers array minus one.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the tests to make sure nothing is broken.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the <code>numberOfNumbers</code> field from the class using <strong>Safe Delete</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run tests.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-6-parameterizing-the-title">Step 6: Parameterizing the title</h2>
<p>The printing of the numbers includes some header information. The first part of that information is the title, the other is the page numbers. We should probably make the title into a parameter that our creators provide, as we don’t know what kinds of numbers they would want us to print. We’ll keep the page number logic as part of our work.</p>
<p>This all will happen in the <code>printHeader</code> method, which currently is a series of <code>System.out.print</code> calls. Our first task would be to bring them together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step merge each of the first two calls into the next one, by prepending its string to the front of the argument. For example after the first step the first two line should have become one call, with argument <code>"The First " + Integer.toString(getNumberOfNumbers())</code>. Run your tests after each step.</li>
<li>Do the same to bring the last two calls together.</li>
<li>Eliminate the <code>Integer.toString</code> parts (leaving their arguments intact, letting the plus operator worry about adding strings to integers.</li>
<li>The <code>"  --- Page "</code> part belongs with the second statement, not the first, so move it over and make sure your tests still pass.</li>
<li>You should now have two <code>System.out...</code> statements, the first one setting the document title, the other setting the page number. We now want to turn the document title into a parameter. Select it and perform “Extract Parameter”, name the parameter <code>title</code>.</li>
<li>Going up to the <code>print</code> method, the title shows up there instead. Do another <code>Extract Parameter</code> to lift it to a parameter of the <code>print</code> method. Your tests should now be failing. Go to the <code>PrimePrinter</code> method and change the call to <code>numberPrinter.getNumberOfNumbers</code> into a reference to the <code>number of primes</code> method instead.</li>
<li>Back in our <code>printHeader</code> method, put the two <code>String.out</code> statements into one, then go anywhere in the string and use the <code>Replace "+" with String.format</code> intention.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-7-make-the-main-loop-clearer">Step 7: Make the main loop clearer</h2>
<p>There is something bothering us about the current structure of the main loop: It is supposed to be printing the next page every time, yet somehow its current structure doesn’t allow for that. Part of the problem is that the page number is currently a field value, and getting updated in mysterious intervals: It is initialized in the <code>initialize</code> method, though nothing about the name of that method suggests that, then is updated at the end of the <code>while</code> loop, which feels a bit backwards. Ideally our loop, and print function, should say:</p>
<pre><code>while there is a next page:
    print the next page</code></pre>
<p>Even better, we should be able to simply say:</p>
<pre><code>for page in pages:
    print page</code></pre>
<p>Or in Java syntax:</p>
<pre><code>for (int page : getPages())
    printPage(page)</code></pre>
<p>In order to achieve this, we need to have an iterator. But before that, we need to have the page number as a parameter to the methods that form our for loop. The page number is used in a number of places:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>printHeader</code> uses it to print the page number on the header.</li>
<li><code>printNumbersOnPage</code> uses it in its <code>getOffset</code> calculation.</li>
<li><code>moveToNextPage</code> actually increments it, which complicates matters considerably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s work through this refactoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with <code>printHeader</code>. Find the use of <code>pageNumber</code> in <code>printHeader</code> and perform <code>Extract Parameter</code> on it. Check that your tests still pass.</li>
<li>Then, inline the <code>moveToNextPage</code> method and remove it. It won’t really be doing much after we move around the page increment, so we’ll just find a better place for the <code>System.out</code> call later. Do the same for the <code>initialize</code> method.</li>
<li>Then look at the <code>getPageOffset</code> method, and perform “Extract Parameter” on the <code>pageNumber</code> variable there. Then move to the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method and perform “Extract Parameter” on the <code>pageNumber</code> variable from there.</li>
<li>Finally, the <code>needToPrintMore</code> method also uses it via <code>getPageOffset</code>, so perform an Extract Parameter from there as well.</li>
<li>Now we hopefully have isolated all the changes of the <code>pageNumber</code> field to the <code>print</code> method. It is set to 1 at the beginning of the <code>print</code> method, then incremented later on. You can confirm that the field is not used elsewhere by moving your cursor over the field declaration and using the “Navigate -&gt; Declaration menu item”. It should show you all the usages.</li>
<li>Now with the cursor on the field declaration, choose the “Convert to local” intention. Then run our tests again to make sure everything works fine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-8-extracting-a-page-class">Step 8: Extracting a Page class</h2>
<p>Thinking through the problem more, it almost feels like we need a separate class to capture the idea of the individual <em>pages</em>. Then that class can incorporate the logic about computing indices and knowing when it’s done, for example. Perhaps we can call this new class a <code>Page</code>. Let’s think through what it would need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>It needs to know its number, currently stored in <code>pageNumber</code>.</li>
<li>It needs to know the row/column dimensions.</li>
<li>It needs to know the actual numbers array to be able to index into it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this class will kind of end up knowing almost all the same stuff as the pretty-printer (except for the title for example). But it does not concern itself with headers and footers for example, or where to output the values. And we might later consider other ways to paginate the page (e.g. numbers going row first). Let’s give this a go:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, turn the <code>pageNumber</code> local variable back into a field (extract field). We are about to do an “extract delegate” refactoring, which works best with fields.</li>
<li>Now perform the “extract delegate” refactoring, which allows you to pull apart fields and methods of one class to another. Name the new class Page, and include in it all the members except for print, printHeader and printNumberOnPage. Make sure to select the “generate accessors” box.</li>
<li>Try to run your tests now, and they should fail. It looks like the problem is that rowsPerPage and columnsPerPage are marked as final, which is correct since they should really only be set once in the constructor. But that’s not how they are set. So let’s see if we can fix that:
<ul>
<li>Back in the <code>NumberPrinter</code>, notice how the <code>page</code> field is initialized at its declaration. Use the “move initializer to constructor” refactoring to bring that into the initializer.</li>
<li>Back in <code>Page</code>, go over the <code>rowsPerPage</code> field and use the “add constructor parameters” refactoring to select both fields and add them to the constructor as parameters.</li>
<li>Back in the <code>NumberPrinter</code> constructor, eliminate the two <code>this.page.set...</code> lines.</li>
<li>Back in <code>Page</code>, use the “Safe delete” intention to remove the various grayed out methods.</li>
<li>Run your tests now and make sure they run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now let’s do some more cleanup. There are some methods back in <code>NumberPrinter</code> that are not being used. Go ahead and use “Safe delete” on them as well.</li>
<li>Now we need to do some cleanup. A number of methods in NumberPrinter are now grayed out, go ahead and use the “Safe delete” intention on them. Make sure your tests still run.</li>
<li>There is a <code>page.setPageNumber(1)</code> call that really should not be needed, as that should be part of the initialization of the page class. Delete that call and instead initialize the <code>pageNumber</code> field in the <code>Page</code> class to 1.</li>
<li>In the <code>Page</code> class, the <code>getPageOffset</code> method no longer needs the <code>pageNumber</code> parameter. Perform the <code>Change Signature</code> refactoring to eliminate its parameter. Run your tests to make sure they are OK.</li>
<li>Next “Safe delete” the unnecessary parameter in <code>needToPrintMore</code>. While we are at it, perform a renaming of it to be simply called <code>hasNext</code>.</li>
<li>Now let’s shift our focus back to the <code>NumberPrinter</code>. Note the last line in the print while loop, which increments the page number by 1. This really should be a method of page. Select the whole expression and perform an “Extract method” refactoring to it, to a new method named <code>nextPage</code>. Then perform a “Move” refactoring to move it to the <code>Page</code> class. Now go to the body of this new method in the <code>Page</code> class, and perform “Inline” refactorings, selecting “this only and keep the method”.</li>
<li>Now the <code>setPageNumber</code> method is probably grayed out. You can perform “Safe delete” on it.</li>
<li>Let’s clean the class up a bit. There are four fields declared, move their declarations near the top, before all the methods. You can use the “Code -&gt; Move Statement Up/Down” shortcuts.</li>
<li>Similarly, move the constructor to be right below them.</li>
<li>There are a number of <code>get...</code> methods. Move them all close to each other below the constructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>printNumberAt</code> method. It feels as though that method is not quite doing what this class should be doing. We want this class to be about computing, for example to compute the index. But the actual printing would be left up to the <code>NumberPrinter</code> class. So our work needs to start from the <code>print</code> method in the <code>NumberPrinter</code> class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the index computation in the argument to the <code>printNumberAt</code> call inside the inner for loop the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method. select that whole argument and extract a method for it: <code>getIndexFor</code>. Then move that to the <code>page</code> method. Then inline the <code>getRowsPerPage</code> call in it.</li>
<li>Back in the <code>printNumbersOnPage</code> method, inline the call to <code>printNumberAt</code> (and remove the method as this is its only occurence).</li>
<li>At this point the system created an <code>index</code> local variable. Go ahead and inline it to eliminate it.</li>
<li>Now the test inside the <code>if</code> should be its own method, so extract it to a method <code>hasEntry</code> then move that method to the <code>Page</code> class.</li>
<li>The second argument to the <code>String.out.printf</code> call should also be its own method, called <code>getEntryAt</code>. This is a bit tricky: Select it and start the “Extract Method” refactoring, and you will see that the “Fold parameters” checkbox is checked. Go ahead and uncheck it, then refactor it and move it to the <code>Page</code> class.</li>
<li>As a final cleanup, the <code>pageNumber</code> parameter is not needed, so perform a “Safe delete” on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s return to the main <code>print</code> method. Remember that our goal was to simplify that loop a bit. Let’s start by putting together the three methods in the while loop: The header printing, the page printing and the footer printing. Call the new method <code>printPage</code>.</p>
<p>Now the <code>while</code> loop looks a lot simpler! It still feels a bit off though, we should be going to the “next page” first. So move the <code>page.nextPage()</code> line up a step. This of course will fail our tests. We will need to adjust <code>pageNumber</code> in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pageNumber</code> should start 0 instead of 1.</li>
<li><code>hasNext</code> should instead use <code>getNextPageOffset</code>, a new method that is like <code>getPageOffset</code> but uses <code>pageNumber</code> instead of <code>pageNumber - 1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have made those changes and created the new method, your tests should again pass.</p>
<p>One final cleanup before calling it a day: The second parameter to <code>printHeader</code> can be inlined. Do that. And the <code>System.out.println("\f");</code> line should really be a method called <code>printFooter</code>, so extract that, then rearrange the methods so that they follow the stepdown rule.</p>
