<h1 id="activity-4-2-design-case-study">Activity 4-2 Design Case Study</h1>
<p>In this case we will think through a small design problem and build the main structure of a small application.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>You are hired by the registrar’s office of a certain college to create a record-keeping application for the college. Here is a description of its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We manage the records of students as they take courses.</li>
<li>We need to be able to add new students, and to enroll students to classes.</li>
<li>Classes are determined by the department prefix, the course number, a section letter and the term when they were offered (we operate on three semesters, Fall, Winter and Spring).</li>
<li>Each class counts for a number of units. 1 is the typical number, but we also have 0.5 and 0.25 units.</li>
<li>Students may not enroll in a class that is the same as a class they have already taken (same department and number, possibly different section and term).</li>
<li>Students who enroll in at least 3 units in Fall or Winter, or in 0.25 units in the Spring semester are considered “full time”. Otherwise they are considered “part-time”.</li>
<li>Students may take up to 4 units in Fall or Winter, and up to 1 unit in the Spring.</li>
<li>Students receive a grade for each class. It can be one of the normal grades, or an IP indicating a course that is “in-progress”. Students may also receive “transfer credit” for a class, which means they have passed the class but there is no grade associated to it (and it’s not part of a normal academic term).</li>
<li>We need to be able to compute the GPA of students both overall as well as within a particular department, and also within a particular term.</li>
<li>We need to be able to generate two kinds of reports:
<ul>
<li>A term-by-term report of the courses a student took each term and the number of units and gpa for that term, as well as overall number of units and gpa.</li>
<li>A department report listing the courses a student took in a particular department as well as computing total units and gpa.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We need to be able to determine if a student can graduate. In order to graduate, a student must have (keeping it simple):
<ul>
<li>A declared major in their record, which is simply a choice of a department.</li>
<li>At least 10 units of credit in that department, including transfer courses and courses that the student has passed.</li>
<li>An overall GPA within the declared major of at least 2.0.</li>
<li>At least 36 units of credit overall.</li>
<li>An overall GPA of at least 2.0.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Our task for today will be to design some of the classes and interfaces that would support this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>
<p>We start by considering a class that represents a term, we’ll call it <code>Term</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What data fields might this <code>Term</code> class contain? What are their types?</li>
<li>Do we need any other classes in order to be able to define the <code>Term</code> class?</li>
<li>What public methods might the <code>Term</code> class have?</li>
<li>Is your class handling limits on how many units a student can take in a semester and what the limit for “full-time” is, or will these happen somewhere else?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we consider a class to represent a particular course offering, we’ll call it <code>Section</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What data fields might this <code>Section</code> class contain? What are their types?</li>
<li>Do we need any other classes in order to be able to define the <code>Section</code> class?</li>
<li>What public methods might the <code>Section</code> class have?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we consider a class to represent a student, we’ll call it <code>Student</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What data fields might this <code>Student</code> class contain? What are their types?</li>
<li>Do we need any other classes in order to be able to define the <code>Student</code> class?</li>
<li>What public methods might the <code>Student</code> class have?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we want to somehow represent the act of a student taking a specific class. We’ll represent this with an <code>Enrollment</code> class.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What data fields might this <code>Enrollment</code> class contain? What are their types?</li>
<li>Do we need any other classes in order to be able to define the <code>Enrollment</code> class?</li>
<li>What public methods might the <code>Enrollment</code> class have?</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine we also have a class that represents our connection to the database. We’ll call it <code>Database</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What data fields might this <code>Database</code> class contain? What are their types?</li>
<li>Do we need any other classes in order to be able to define the <code>Database</code> class?</li>
<li>What public methods might the <code>Database</code> class have?</li>
<li>Should this actually be an <em>interface</em> instead of a class?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we want classes to represent the various requests that might come to our system.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What are all the different requests that might come?</li>
<li>What pieces of information does each request need to hold?</li>
<li>Is there any common behavior that all these requests share?</li>
</ol>
<p>What other classes would we need in our system?</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
let els = document.getElementsByTagName("pre");
for (const el of els) {
  const lang = el.getAttribute("class");
  if (lang != "") {
      el.children[0].setAttribute("class", "language-"+lang);
  }
}
