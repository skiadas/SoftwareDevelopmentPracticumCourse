<h1 id="java-variables">Java Variables</h1>
<p>THERESA IS STILL WORKING ON THIS</p>
<pre class="java"><code>public class Point {
  private int x;
  private int y;

  public Point (int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  public int getX() {
    return x;
  }

  public int getY() {
    return y;
  }

  public void shift(int xChange, int yChange) {
    x += xChange;
    y += yChange;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Part 1: Static variables</p>
<p>Sometimes there are variables that can or should be shared between all the objects in the class. These are called class variables or static variables.</p>
<p>Need examples.</p>
<p>Goal: Design a class to represent circles. What would we want our circle to be able to do? - create new circle given radius and center - calculate area - calculate perimeter - given a point, determine if point is inside the circle - shift circle to have a new center - scale radius - getCenter - getRadius</p>
<p>What instance variables would we need to have? center radius</p>
<p>Write constructor: What parameters should the constructor have?</p>
<p>What are the accessors? Write those methods.</p>
<p>Question: Aside from the accessors, which methods can do their job just using the instance variables?</p>
<p>==&gt; Should lead to a discussion of needing pi for calculating area and perimeter. - How &amp; where should we declare a variable for pi? - What sort of variable should pi be?</p>
<p>==&gt; Talk about keywords “static” and “final”. “final” here means the value of the variable cannot be changed, i.e., it’s a constant.</p>
<p>Write the signatures for remaining methods. Have groups compare answers. This will hopefully raise questions.</p>
<p>REPORT OUT: - Were there disagreements in the name for methods? Names for parameters? - Were there disagreements about what should be returned. For example, shift and rescale. - Decide as a class on final signatures for our methods.</p>
<p>Write the implementations (at the board)</p>
<p>Questions: - Could the center or the radius be declare final? Should they? - How would you do the shift for the circle if the point class didn’t have a shift method? Would that cause any problems. - What if the shift method was returning a new point instead of changing it’s own fields. How would your Circle implementation need to change? - Suppose we change shift and rescale to return a new Circle, instead of changing the existing circle. Could the fields for the Circle be changed to final? What would be the implications of doing this, assuming it is possible?</p>
<p>REPORT OUT: - Go over questions.</p>
