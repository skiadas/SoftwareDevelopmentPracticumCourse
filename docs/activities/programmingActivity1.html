<h1 id="programming-activity-1">Programming Activity 1</h1>
<p>You have one hour to complete a program that reads a series of courses and grades, and returns a summary of how many courses there are and what the average GPA is. The format of the data you will be reading is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>CS  234         A
MAT 243         B+
...</code></pre>
<p>Namely, each line consists of a sequence of letters indicating the department, followed by a number of spaces and then the course number. After one or more spaces a letter grade for the course is present. The letter grades correspond to GPA scores as follows:</p>
<pre><code>A    4.00
A-   3.67
B+   3.33
B    3.00
B-   2.67
C+   2.33
C    2.00
C-   1.67
D+   1.33
D    1.00
F    0
W    The course should not count at all towards the total or the GPA calculation.</code></pre>
<p>You are given some start code to help you get started. You will need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check out (clone) the <code>grades</code> project from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sdp-resources/grades" class="uri">https://github.com/sdp-resources/grades</a></li>
<li>Start a new IntelliJ project based off of the directory where you cloned the project.</li>
<li>Make sure to include the JUnit4 library to the classpath, by using the intention context menu on the import part of <code>Main.java</code>.</li>
<li>There are a few tests there in the Main class, which you can run by <em>creating a new JUnit4 configuration to run all tests in the package <code>sdp</code></em>. They should all be failing right now.</li>
</ol>
<p>The method you need to write, <code>processGrades</code> is given as input a “scanner”. A scanner is going to skip whitespaces and return the remaining “tokens” to you when you call an appropriate <code>next...</code> method of it. Check out the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Java Scanner documentation</a> for more details.</p>
