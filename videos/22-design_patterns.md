### Concepts

- **pattern** ~ a solution applied more than once to a problem scenario when it occurs in a particular context

- **Types of *design patterns* (for software development)**
	- **creational pattern**
		~ pattern that helps with the creation of an instance of an object
	- **structural pattern**
		~ pattern that helps with the setup of communication pathwayw between different groups of objects
	- **behavioral pattern**
		~ pattern that helps with the partitioning of system behaviors into discrete classes

- **command** (in software development) ~ an object whose job is to store all the information needed to execute a particular action. See [https://www.baeldung.com/java-command-pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/java-command-pattern).

- **Command pattern** ~ an interface, typically named `Command`, with a single method, typically named `Execute`.
