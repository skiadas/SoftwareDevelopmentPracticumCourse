## Test Design, Episode 21

### Timing:

- 00:00-03:10 overview
- 03:10-08:05 test location
- 08:05-13:12 test files
- 13:12-15:25 test suites
- 15:25-31:26 SOLID tests
	- 19:00 SRP for tests

	- 24:55 LSP for tests
	- 26:10 ISP for tests
	- 27:42 DIP for tests

- 31:26-50:55 writing tests ("test location" on video)
- 50:55-53:30 summary
- 53:30-56:31 ending credits (may skip)

### Concepts:

- What test to write first? Write the test that forces you to write the code that you already know you want to write.
- Given, When, Then
- One way to name tests is to use the Action (the When) and the Assertion (the Then).
