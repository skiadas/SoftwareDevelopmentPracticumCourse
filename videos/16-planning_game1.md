Timing:

- 00:00-00:50    opening
- 00:50-02:50    episode introduction
- 02:50-11:15    black hole evaporation rates
- **11:15-15:15  the iron cross**
    - What are the four attributes of a software project?
    - What does the "iron cross of project management" say about the relation between those dimensions?
- **15:15-22:20  velocity**
    - The velocity chart
    - The burndown chart
    - Relation between velocity chart and burndown chart
    - Agile is about getting bad news out early enough for managers to manage the project
    - We do agile to measure how fast we go
- **22:20-37:40  iterations**
    - In software development, dates are frozen but features are always changing
    - Iteration zero: Initial exploration, analysis and design
    - Iterations have fixed time
    - Iterations never fail
    - Iterations are there to produce data
- **37:40-46:40  scope management**
    - Schedule unlikely to change, though possible to change early on
    - New people initially slow down the productivity
    - Quality of code should not be sacrificed (but can adjust quality of ui/features)
    - Scope is the most amenable to change
- **46:40-50:15  the circle of life**
    - Individual disciplines: Pairing, TDD, Refactoring, Simple Design
    - Technical Team disciplines: Continuous Integration, Collective Ownership, Sustainable Pace, Metaphor
