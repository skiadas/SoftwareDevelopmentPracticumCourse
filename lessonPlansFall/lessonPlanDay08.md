# Day 8 Lesson Plan


## In-class work: Reading code and UML diagrams

Work in groups, pick a computer close to a board.

- [Exploring OOP Code and some UML diagrams](../activities/activity1-6objectsAndBasicUML.md)
- Draw the UML diagram for the last phase of the [grading-refactoring](../activities/activity2-2refactoringHandout.md).
- Discuss the following questions:
    - If we wanted to change something in the way grades are read, which classes would be affected?
    - If we wanted to change something in how the summary statistics are shown, which classes would be affected?
    - If we wanted to change the policy about how much grades contribute to the gpa and/or which grades actually contribute, which classes would be affected?
    - If we wanted to add the ability to read the grades in different formats, e.g. maybe the letter grade comes first and then the course prefix and number, what classes would be affected?
    - If we wanted to allow multiple export formats (e.g. XML/HTML or some sort of tabular form), is this possible to do with the current structure of the code?
