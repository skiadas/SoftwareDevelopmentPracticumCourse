# Basics of working in iterations

- **incremental** and **iterative**
- work in small **time-boxed iterations**
- deliver something new on each iteration, obtain **feedback** from client
- maintain list of  **user stories** (small independent goals with concrete business value)
- developers estimate **story points** for each user story depending on time to code
- client prioritizes the user stories based on business value
- team computes its **velocity** (number of story points done in an iteration)
- each iteration ends with a **demo** of the new functionality
- each iteration starts with a **planning meeting** to decide which user stories to implement
- **Iteration zero** is an initial iteration where the initial list of user stories is compiled
