# Activity 1

You have one hour to complete a program that reads a series of courses and grades, and returns a summary of how many courses there are and what the average GPA is. The format of the data you will be reading is as follows:

```
CS  234         A
MAT 243         B+
...
```

Namely, each line consists of a sequence of letters indicating the department, followed by a number of spaces and then the course number. After one or more spaces a letter grade for the course is present. The letter grades correspond to GPA scores as follows:
```
A    4.00
A-   3.67
B+   3.33
B    3.00
B-   2.67
C+   2.33
C    2.00
C-   1.67
D+   1.33
D    1.00
F    0
W    The course should not count at all towards the total or the GPA calculation.
```

You are given some start code to help you get started.
```java
