# Activity 4 - More Practice with IntelliJ: Implement the `Circle` class

For this activity you will be creating a new IntelliJ project starting with some existing source code.

## Starting up

- Go to [https://skiadas.github.io/SoftwareDevelopmentPracticumCourse/](https://skiadas.github.io/SoftwareDevelopmentPracticumCourse/) and then *Schedule/Notes -> Activities for Day 1*.
- Go to Activity 4 and follow the [source code](https://github.com/sdp-resources/basicGraphing/releases/tag/WritingCircleAssignment) link.
- Right-click on either source code link (zip format), then download the file by selecting *Save as*. Be sure to save the file in your CS321 directory.
- Unzip the file to create a directory called "basicGraphing-WritingCircleAssignment".
- In IntelliJ, select *File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources*.
- Follow the Next buttons until you can choose a project name and location.
- Click Finish to accept the suggested project name and location.

## Implement the `Circle` class.

- Take a look around at the source code you have been given.
    - Notice that there are two packages (`shape` and `ui`) and a `Main` class at the top-level of the `src` folder.
    - The `shape` package contains two classes: `Circle` and `Point`.
- Try running the code:
    - Open "Main.java" and click on the green triangle to the left of `public static void main...` to try running the code.
    - At this point, the build process should fail with lots of complaints about the `Circle` class, which still needs to be implemented.
- In "Circle.java", add the implementation for the `Circle` class that we developed in **Activity 3**.
- Once you get `Main` built and running, try out the simple interactive interface for testing the `Circle` class.
